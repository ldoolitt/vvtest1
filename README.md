Disposable test of versioning

Testbed for possible solutions to
https://github.com/verilator/verilator/issues/3352
based on ideas from @quark17.
The point is to leverage github features controlled by the .gitattributes file
to get tagged snapshots identified as such.

This repo will contain snippets of Verilator files, and should
thus be considered GPLv3-licensed.
